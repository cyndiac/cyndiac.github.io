This year, our team made it to the championships in Houston! We were on a division-winning alliance, which was a great experience for all the students.

In the initial design process, we narrowed down the game to key tasks that we thought our team could achieve, and to keep things mechanically simple, we built two independent shooting mechanisms - one side for the cones and one side for the cubes. It certainly was more challenging than expected to transition from our shop-tuned high accuracy to our initially low accuracy at competitions. The process taught me what to expect (or not expect) when running the robot in new environments with different lighting conditions and game piece wear & tear.

We still built a memorable and creative robot, and that brings me the most joy :)
