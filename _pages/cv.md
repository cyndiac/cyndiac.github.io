A PDF version of my CV is available [here](../files/Cao_CV.pdf).

Education
======
* B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, June 2017
* Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering, **UC Berkeley**, July 2023
    * Specialization in design and control
    * Thesis: Roving around the moon and Mars: strategic wheel slip control and active weight redistribution for augmenting wheeled mobility

Work Experience
======
* [Aug 2018 - present] **Embodied Dexterity Group** - Graduate Student Researcher
  * Built sub-scale rovers and data collection setups to study the impact of slip controllers for mobility on loose, sandy terrain.
  * Performed validation testing with NASA's VIPER (lunar rover) team, and led testing and data analysis for evaluation of VIPER's load-responsive suspension controllers.
  * Achieved an 8x efficiency improvement in slope climbing using strategically induced slip in articulated suspensions.
  * Refined and applied terrain models to explain and predict unintuitive results.
  * Performed research and experiments at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Glenn Research Center, and Ames Research Center

* [Jan-Aug 2018] **Apple** - Watch Product Design Intern
  * Analyzed users’ wrist interactions in various sports to quantify impact loads and environmental factors, then proposed validation tests including machine requirements and SOPs.
  * Produced GD&T drawings and tolerance stacks for small, complex assemblies and fasteners.
  * Designed interface-representative frames for environmental testing of individual sub-assemblies.

* [Aug-Dec 2017] **SpaceX** - Mechanisms Intern
  * Upgraded propulsion structures and their manufacturing tooling, and verified their structural integrity via FEA in ANSYS.
  * Tested electrical components under vibration, shock, and separation loads for flight qualification.

Teaching Experience
======
* [Fall 2019 - present] **FIRST Robotics Team 5419** - Lead Technical Mentor
    * Mentored 30-60 high school students as they built 120 pound robots in 7 weeks and competed and upgraded the robot for another 7 weeks.
    * Fostered students’ critical thinking upon facing structural failures, CAD & fabrication inconsistencies, or other challenges.
	* Guided the software team to integrate automation in robot control and develop comprehensive competition scouting analysis.
* [Summer 2017, 2019] **Summer Science Program** - Teaching Assistant
    * Tutored high school seniors in orbital mechanics and programming to track near-Earth asteroids and calculate their orbital elements.
    * Assisted students with homework and telescope observation sessions, and organized social activities.
