A PDF version of my CV is available [here](../files/Cao_CV.pdf).

Education
======
* B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, **Massachusetts Institute of Technology**, June 2017
* Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering, **UC Berkeley**, July 2023
    * Specialization in design and control
    * Thesis: Roving around the moon and Mars: strategic wheel slip control and active weight redistribution for augmenting wheeled mobility

Work Experience
======
* [Aug 2018 - present] **Embodied Dexterity Group** - Graduate Student Researcher
  * Explored the impact of wheel-ground contact loads and slip control on the mobility of rovers traversing loose, sandy terrain and climbing large obstacles
  * Ran extensive test campaigns using both miniature rovers and NASA's VIPER lunar rover mobility test unit
  * Developed and deployed specialized terrain models to motivate new wheel slip controls

* [Jan-Aug 2018] **Apple** - Watch Product Design Intern
  * Analyzed users' wrist interactions in various water sports to quantify impact loads and environmental factors and to design appropriate test procedures
  * Produced GD&T drawings and tolerance stacks for small, complex assemblies

* [Aug-Dec 2017] **SpaceX** - Mechanisms Intern
  * Upgraded propulsion components in preparation for 10-flight qualification; verified their structural integrity via FEA in ANSYS

Teaching Experience
======
* [Fall 2019 - present] **FIRST Robotics Team 5419** - Lead Technical Mentor
    * Mentored 30-60 high school students as they built 120 pound robots in 7 weeks and competed and upgraded the robot for another 7 weeks
    * Fostered students' critical thinking upon facing structural failures, CAD & fabrication inconsistencies, and/or controller instabilities
* [Summer 2017, 2019] **Summer Science Program** - Teaching Assistant
    * Tutored high school seniors in orbital mechanics and programming to track near-Earth asteroids and calculate their orbital elements
    * Assisted students with homework and telescope observation sessions, and organized social activities
